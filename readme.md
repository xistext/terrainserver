This is a terrain client/server demo implemented using the
Castle Game Engine and Indy libaries using Lazarus/FPC though it should build
with Delphi.

Though client/server, it is currently only configured to work on the local
machine.

This is prototype proof-of-concept code and will contain bugs.  You may use it
as you see fit with the understanding that it is incomplete.

You will need to build and run both the client and the server.
